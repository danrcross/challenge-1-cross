# challenge-1-cross

## Description

This project was developed as a means to practice and understand how to code a website that adheres to accessibility standards.
Semantic HTML elements were used in lieu of generic elements.
This ensures that the site is optimized for search engines (SEO).
This allows for the website to be easily navigated by persons who might have disabilities. The browser can more readily read the HTML to employ accessibility functions.
This project also helped me to locate and remove redundancies. It helped me to better code my HTML using class and id attributes. It helped me to simplify the way that the HTML document communicates with the CSS stylesheet.
